### Thanks

Thanks so much to everyone who helped. There's probably tons more, but: dblue, cortex, pandabot, ffx, joule, avaruus, astu/flo, mmd(mr mark dollin) syflom, protman, ViZiON, ghostwerk, vV, Bantai, danoise, taktik, Snowrobot, mxb, jenoki, kmaki, mantrakid, aleksip and the whole Renoise community.

### Who made it possible

Thanks to @lpn (Brothomstates) for suggesting that I could pick up and learn LUA, that it would not be beyond me. Really appreciate
your (sometimes misplaced and ahead-of-time) faith in me. And thanks for the inspiration.
